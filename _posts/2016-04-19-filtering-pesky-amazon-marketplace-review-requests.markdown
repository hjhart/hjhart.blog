<span class='newthought'>I order a lot from Amazon.com</span> My wife orders a ton from amazon. Just recently we've received an influx of emails from marketplace vendors asking for feedback.

I really don't want to do that. I'd rather have the marketplace vendors be completely obfuscated from me, and me just know that I'm ordering from _Amazon_.

So, after receiving two emails requesting feedback in one day, which happened to be the 25th time _this year_ of having feedback requested, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

Here's the filter you want to create on gmail:
```
from:*@marketplace.amazon.com 
```

Then, Skip the inbox and you're good to go! No more pesky feedback requests from Amazon marketplace vendors.
