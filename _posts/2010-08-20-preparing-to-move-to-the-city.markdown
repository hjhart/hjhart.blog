The official move date has been set, the rental truck reservations have been made, the lease has been signed. I'm ready to move down to San Francisco. On the 31st of August, I will have moved out of my current apartment in Capitol Hill completely, and my stuff will be placed into a 10 foot by 16 foot rental truck. On the 2nd of September, me and two lovely ladies will park our bottoms into three adjacent bucket seats for approximately 13 hours and drive until we reach the Bay Area.

Exciting stuff, I know.

Having lived in Seattle for 23 years (my entire life), I've decided it's time to move to a different city. San Francisco seems like a good transition city, being that it is still on the west coast and it's inhabitants have certain qualities that are similar to those of Seattle. Plus, if there is a market that is chugging along in San Francisco, the tech industry would be it.

So I'm taking a leap of faith, and it's a bit nerve wracking, but overall, I'm excited.

There is so much to look forward to: new local music, walking _everywhere_, meeting people, taking pictures of a new city, new restaurants. Even normal activities will be interesting again â€” solely because they're happening in a different city.

Mostly though, I'm looking forward to being finished with moving. I friggin' _hate_ moving.
