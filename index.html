  My name is James Hart. I've been a software engineer for 19 years. I started
  my career off in San Francisco üåÅ for five years, and now I work from home in
  Seattle üåß. I like to build products that provide value to members and feedback
  to the business. I've built and mentored many teams to do so!
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently a Principal Engineer on the product team at
  <a href="https://hellobrightline.com">Brightline</a>. I switched over to the
  mobile team in 2022 to help support building their native iOS and android
  apps. Previously, I was the Principal engineer at
  <a

    >Voom Flights</a
  >
  for two years.
</p>
<p>
  My native habitat is Rails, TypeScript, and a terminal shell, but I have
  experience with many other technologies ‚Äì and I love learning. I've built on
  the entire stack, from fully accessible front-ends to automating deployment of
  new servers and CI/CD pipelines. I value testing, developer process, and
  automation. Personally, I like trying new restaurants, cooking, backpacking
  and moto-camping.
